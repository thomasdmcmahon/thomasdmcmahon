<h2 align="left">ðŸ‘‹Hey I'm Thomas, welcome to my space!</h2>

<p align="left">

I'm a 23 year-old computer sciecne student at the University of Oslo ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´, driven by the idea that technology should not only solve problems but also help us build a more sustainable future. Lately, I've become especially interested in the **intersection of computer science, AI and sustainability**. I believe that the technologies we build today should not only be efficient and innovative, but also contribute to a more sustainable and responsible world. Whether it's designing smarter systems, improving automation, or exploring the potential of large language models, I'm motivated by the idea of creating solutions that balance technical progress with real-world impact.

I see coding as both a craft and a tool for exploration and creativity. I love learning, experimenting, and collaborating â€“ and I'm always excited to connect with others who share the same curiosity and drive to make a difference.
