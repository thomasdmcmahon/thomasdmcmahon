<h2 align="left">👋Hey I'm Thomas, welcome to my space!</h2>

<p align="left">

I'm a 23 year old, Norwegian computer science student at the University of Oslo 🇳🇴, driven by the idea that technology should not only solve problems, but also help us build a better, safer, and more sustainable future. I've become especially interested in the intersection of **computer science, AI, and sustainability**. Whether it's designing smarter systems, improving automation, or exploring the potential of LLMs I find myself motivated by the idea of creating solutions that balance technological progress with real-world impact🍃🌍💚
